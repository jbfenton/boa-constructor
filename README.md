# Boa Constructor
## An Overview

Hello and thanks for dropping in to check out Boa Constructor. Boa Constructor is an IDE originally written in 1999. It runs in Python and uses wxPython for its GUI elements and controls. In 1999, Python and wxPython were very different and have evolved over the itervening time. So much so that the original Boa Constructor code will no longer run on current releases of Python or wxPython. This project was created to "uplift" the code to get Boa working again in modern programming environments.

Boa Constructor is described as a Rapid Application Development tool. Apart from features common to most IDEs such as a full-featured editor, a built-in debugger, TODO functions, Bookmarking, etc Boa also features a GUI-based GUI builder. This means you can graphically build your applications window frame, its menus, its toolbars and buttons, its text entry areas and other controls. There are many built=in wxPython controls available for use in your application; colour picker, Directory Navigation dialogue and file selection, various dialogue boxes to communicate with your user. wxPython has many other controls like radio buttons, spinners, sliders, combo boxes, etc all available for you to pick-and-click into your application.

Boa Constructor presumes your application will operate in the Model-View-Controller framework. Part of the basic design flow in Boa is to select controls and lay them out graphically to make up you user interface and select the events they generate that need to be managed. As such, a project should start its life in Boa Constructor and continue to completion. It is difficult to migrate an existing program into Boa.

## The Project

The project is ongoing. There are still many parts of Boa that are not yet functional but most of the basics are there for you to get started. There is enough functionality to complete the original Boa Constructor tutorial activity that demonstrates how to use Boa to create basic applications. More functionaity will be available in later releases as I get more working. You can watch how things are progressing by going to the *Discussion* section (in the menu near the top of the page) and look for **"Day-by-Day Progress Reporting Diary"**. Despite the title, updates are approximately weekly. Don't forget to click on the *Newest* button to see the latest updates.

If you have the desire and skill to help resurrect Boa Constructor, I would love to hear from you.

## Installation / Project Setup

### Prerequisites
This project is managed with UV - An extremely fast Python package and project manager, written in Rust. 

Run the appropriate bootstrap script to install UV on your system.
- Windows: `bootstrap.bat`
- Linux / MacOS: `bootstrap.sh`

#### Verifying UV Installation
1. In a new command prompt / terminal window
2. Run `uv self version` to confirm UV is installed


### Getting The Source Code
#### Using the command line
1. Using the command line:
   Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository and run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ianBBB/boa-constructor
```
  
#### Downloading the ZIP file
1. Go to the GitHub page: https://github.com/ianBBB/boa-constructor
2. Use the green button marked "Code" to download the ZIP file containing Boa Constructor
3. Save the ZIP file to your local machine in a directory of your choice
4. Extract the contents of the ZIP file to a directory on your local machine

### Installing/Running Boa Constructor
#### Simple
Run the provided script for your platform:
- Windows: `run.bat`
- Linux / MacOS: `run.sh`

#### Manual - Windows/MacOS/Linux
1. Open a command prompt / terminal window
2. Navigate to the directory where you cloned or extracted the repository
3. Run the following command
```commandline
uv run Boa.py
```
This command will:
1. Download the correct version of Python
2. Set up a virtual environment
3. Install the required dependencies
4. Launch Boa Constructor.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. The easiest way to contribute is to set up the project locally, make a focused change, run the project checks, and then open a pull request.

### Suggested contributor workflow

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `make bootstrap` from the repository root. This runs the platform bootstrap script, installs `uv`, and then installs the project's `pre-commit` hooks.
3. Start Boa locally with `run.bat`, `run.sh`, or `uv run Boa.py`.
4. Make your code changes.
5. Review `git status` before running any formatting commands so you know what is already modified.
6. Run `make format` to apply the project's Ruff formatting and safe autofixes.
7. Run `make check` to confirm formatting and linting pass.
8. Review the final diff and open a pull request.

If you need to install the hooks manually, run `uv run pre-commit install`.

To run the hooks manually across the repository, run `uv run pre-commit run --all-files`.

## Code Quality Checks

This project uses Ruff for formatting and linting.

### Format the code

```bash
make format
```

This runs Ruff's autofix pass first and then applies Ruff formatting.

### Check formatting and linting

```bash
make check
```

This runs Ruff in check-only mode and should pass before you open a pull request.

### Important note about scope

Both `make format` and `make check` run across the repository, not just the files you changed. On a large or older branch, `make format` may update many files at once. Check `git status` before and after running it so you can tell which changes are yours.

## Preparing a Pull Request

Before opening a pull request:

1. Run `make check` and confirm it passes.
2. Review the diff to make sure broad formatting changes did not accidentally get mixed with unrelated work.
3. If you are changing Ruff configuration or other shared tooling, prefer to keep that change separate from large formatting-only updates when practical. Splitting those changes makes review easier.
